Do you wanna create more than one trial account on exitlag? So this 'spoofer' is for you!

## Why? 

Exitlag limit the trial account creation to ONE account per HWID. You don't suppost to create more than one trial account with the same pc, because they get the HWID when you do login on their program and store it.
So what this bypass do is: after 

## How to use?
- Compile (or download the released version) and execute this program. Then execute ExitLag.
- Login with a new account (create one with a tempemail, such has <a href="https://www.developermail.com/mail/">this one</a>).
- You gonna see that there are 3 days of trial.
Yes, you need to do this with every new account.
    
## How it works?
  - We hook some place in the assembly before it send the login request
  - Then we change the HWID to some other (rand letters)
  When the request is made to the server, the server will think it is a new pc and it will give us 3 days of trial.		

### This may help you

 - I made a <a href="https://greasyfork.org/pt-BR/scripts/420383-automatic-create-account-exitlag">greasyfork script</a> to automatic fill the fields of email and password. 
 - So, with one click you can create a new account.
 - I just didn't make a thing to create tons of accounts because they have a google captcha.


### TODO
(bugs)
 - The rand function may change the address position when exitlag update. I need to get the start address of the rand dll then sum the offset of the function, if that make sense.
